### Entities and Attributes
```

Entity        | Attributes                                               | Primary Key   | Foreign Key
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEMBER        | member_id, name, membership_type, start_date             | member_id     | -
TRAINER       | trainer_id, trainer_name, specialization, phone_number   | trainer_id | -
PROGRAM       | program_id, program_name, duration, schedule             | program_id    | -
SESSION       | session_id, session_date, session_time                   | session_id    | member_id
PAYMENT       | payment_id, payment_type, amount, payment_date           | payment_id | member_id
ATTENDANCE    | attendance_id, status                                    | attendance_id | session_id
```

### Relationships and Constraints
```

Relationship | Entities Involved        | Cardinality | Participation | Notes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASSIGNED_TO  | TRAINER – PROGRAM       | M : N       | Partial       | A trainer can teach many programs and a program can have many trainers
JOINS        | MEMBER – PROGRAM        | M : N       | Partial       | Members can join multiple fitness programs
BOOKS        | MEMBER – SESSION        | 1 : M       | Partial       | A member can book many personal training sessions
ATTENDS      | SESSION – ATTENDANCE    | 1 : N       | Total         | Each session has multiple attendance records
MAKES        | MEMBER – PAYMENT        | 1 : N       | Partial       | Members can make multiple payments
```

### Assumptions
- Each member has a unique Member_ID.
- Trainers can teach multiple programs.
- Programs can have multiple trainers.

### Entities and Attributes
```

Entity     | Attributes                                   | Primary Key | Foreign Key
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
MEMBER     | M_ID, Name, Email, Phno, Addr                | M_ID        | -
BOOK       | Book_ID, Title, Author, Category             | Book_ID     | -
LOAN       | Loan_ID, Loan_Date, Return_Date, F_Amt       | Loan_ID     | M_ID, Book_ID
EVENT      | Event_ID, Event_Name, Date, Time             | Event_ID    | -
SPEAKER    | Speaker_ID, Name, Expertise                  | Speaker_ID  | Event_ID
ROOM       | Room_ID, Room_Name, Capacity                 | Room_ID     | Event_ID
```

### Relationships and Constraints
```

Relationship | Entities Involved      | Cardinality | Participation | Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BORROWS      | MEMBER – LOAN         | 1 : M       | Partial       | A member can borrow many books
LOAN_BOOK    | LOAN – BOOK           | M : 1       | Total         | Each loan refers to one specific book
REGISTERS    | MEMBER – EVENT        | M : N       | Partial       | Members can register for multiple events
HAS          | EVENT – SPEAKER       | 1 : M       | Total         | Each event may have one or more speakers
